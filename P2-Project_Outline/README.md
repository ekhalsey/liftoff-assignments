# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project is a way to track habits or symptoms in order to spot trends or maintain accountability. It will allow users to input which habits they would like to track and then allow them to submit a form on how those symptoms are doing at different points in time. with this data entered they will be able to see a graph representing their chosen symptoms showing their inputs over time. It allows them to see the changes not only in each symptom, but potentially spot relationships and/or correlations between them. Would like to include ways to filter which symptoms are displayed on the graph and potentially a way to view notes attached to each data point.

### Features
-LogIn/Registration
-Collect user symptom data

### Technologies
-Java
-SpringBoot

### What I'll Have to Learn
Will need to learn how to incorporate graphs into this project. Would like to include single sign on/OAuth2 or something more sophisticated for login/registration
